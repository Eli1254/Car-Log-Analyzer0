## Getting Started

1. **Upload your datalog CSV** file using the upload control on the main page.
2. Optionally upload a **second CSV** to compare two logs side-by-side.
3. Use the **sidebar filters** to narrow your data by RPM, throttle position, and load.
4. Select a **smoothing preset** or customize smoothing parameters for smoother graphs.
5. Add **custom event markers** to annotate key moments in your data.

## Notes

- Ensure your CSV contains columns like `Time (sec)`, `RPM (RPM)`, `Boost (psi)`, `Req Torque (Nm)`, `Ignition Timing (Â°)`, `Calculated Load (g/rev)`, and knock/AFR sensors for full functionality.
- Smoothing presets help clean noisy data but can be fine-tuned.
- Use event markers to highlight significant data points or moments in the log.
- Some features require specific columns; the app will warn if missing.

*Beta Version (Tested for subaru but may work with other vehicles using csvs files through COBB or Open Source software).*

*Horsepower estimation is a very ball-park estimate based on rough calculations and requires the parameters: Time (sec), RPM (RPM), and Req Torque (Nm) to function properly.*
